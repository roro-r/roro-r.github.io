                  <h3>Welcome to the Cliff Avril Family Foundation</h3>
                  <p>Super Bowl Champion Cliff Avril started the Cliff Avril Family Foundation in March 2014. Inspired by
                     the loss of his grandmother and his mother’s diagnosis of diabetes, Cliff realized the importance of
                     educating today’s youth about healthy living.
                  </p>
                  <p>The Cliff Avril Family Foundation mission is to increase the awareness of Type 2 diabetes in youth
                     and to encourage healthy living through nutrition and exercise. As well as provide educational
                     support and opportunities to youth in Haiti, along with various community-based organizations in
                     Jacksonville, Seattle and Charlotte.

                        <h1>Story 1</h1>
                        <p>Seattle Seahawks defensive end Cliff Avril traveled to Haiti in January 2018 to help build two classrooms in a poor community. The project was organized by the WE Charity, formerly known as Free The Children. Avril learned about the opportunity through a connection from his former teammate, Marshawn Lynch.

                           The old school building in La Chanm had no walls, just a tin roof held up by wooden beams. The structure was much too small to accommodate the 500 children that attended grades K-6. Avril and the other volunteers worked for several days to build two new classrooms. The new classrooms are made of concrete and have walls, windows, and doors. They will provide a much-needed space for the children to learn.
                           
                           Avril said that he was inspired to help build the schools in honor of his father, who was a teacher. He said that he wanted to give back to the community and help make a difference in the lives of the children in Haiti.
                           
                           The project was a success, and the new classrooms were completed on time. The children are now able to learn in a safe and comfortable environment. Avril is proud of the work that he and the other volunteers did, and he is glad that he was able to make a difference in the lives of the children in Haiti..
